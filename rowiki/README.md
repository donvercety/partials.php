Found a working archive of this wiki engine [here][link_v1.02] (`v1.02`) - be careful your eyes will hurt. The
original link above is **EOL**. Slightly newer, but buggier version (maybe not released officially) is available to
download [here][link_v1.05] (`v1.05`), backed-up by the [LionWiki][lionwiki] project, which is a descendant of **roWiki**.

Looks like this project is long dead, the final code update was around 2005.

This version of **roWiki** was created mainly from `v1.02`, with some additions from `v1.05`. Resulting in a new **roWiki** version `v1.10` - after 17 years.

## Updates
- PHP 7.x support
- Read-only mode
- Many fixed issues
- Complete template redesign
- Mobile friendly
