!!! Help Page
Here is an overview of all the formatting-rules you can use in "'''roWiki'''". Press "Edit" button at the bottom, to see how everything is done.
(If you only see "Locked Page", refer to the documentation to find out how to unlock a page!)

'''Headings''' -- using `!`
`<h1>` - used for the page title.
{{
<h2> = !!! Biggest
<h3> = !! Bigger
<h4> = ! Big
}}
'''Font faces''' -- using `'`
- '''Bold'''
- ''italics''
- '''''both'''''

'''Ordered lists''' -- using `#`
# First
# Second
# Third

'''Unordered lists''' -- using `*`
* First
* Second
* Third

'''Code''' -- using 2 ''curly brackets'' or ''back-ticks''
{{<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      ...
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>}}

'''External links and eMail - addresses''', either automatically...
- http://www.rowlff.de/rowiki
- rowiki@rowlff.de

..or with an arbitrary link-text with the help of square brackets
- [Go to roWiki original|http://www.rowlff.de/rowiki]
- [Go to roWiki new|https://github.com/donvercety/partials.php/tree/master/rowiki]

'''Images''' work automatically as well, just include the `URL` of the image you want

https://i.ibb.co/gjyNP4h/Fuck-O-Meter.gif

'''Links''' to wiki-pages, using square brackets:
- [Home]

..if a page does not exist, it will be created the first time you click on the link. Click on "Sandbox" and you can simply write this new page..
- [Sandbox]
- [New Page]


'''Horizontal line''' -- using `----`

Try it out! Once you get used to it, it's pretty simple `(^_^)`
